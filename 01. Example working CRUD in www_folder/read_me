This is specifically for portal pages only

    # it was a bit confusing at first, 
    # due to frappe's file based routing for portal pages, frappe looks for a file in your www folder
    # hence when you go to a url, like todo_app/list it will look for list.html in your www folder

    # Additionally when you pass a parameter in your url, it still routes to a file.
    # So even your detail pages, form pages, etc should be html files with their context coming from the corresponding python file
    # (list.html, list.py)
    # when you pass a parameter, the context will automatically get the passed parameters and return whatever you return to the html page.

Look in the hooks.py file for the url configurations and read the comments in that file.
