This is specifically for portal pages only - so our html files are in the www folder.

I created an app called test_app 
with a doctype called Book with fields: name and author

I created some whitelisted methods in the api folder - this folder must be at the same directory level as the www folder
The whitelisted methods are located in test_app/api/books.py file

e.g. route in my html is:     

<div>
        <button hx-get="/api/method/test_app.api.books.new_book_form" hx-target="#book-form">
            New Book
        </button>
</div>

Since i am using the frappe inbuilt way to access custom api methods - it means you don't have to configure
url in the hooks.py
